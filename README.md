post_tools
==========

A bunch of tools I wrote to help with my video post-production workflows. Shake well before using, use at your own risk.


* **projectfolders:**

  Creates skeleton project-folder heirarchies (based on specific workflow) in the current working directory. In my workflow, I like to separate different parts of the post-production workflow into their own separate folders (since generally, each task is done by a separate person in our facility, and I prefer to let them have their own "playground" in which they can work in), so this script creates top-level skeleton heirarchies for Color Correction, Offline Editorial and Online Editorial workflows.
